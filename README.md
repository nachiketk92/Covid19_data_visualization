# Covid19 Data Visualization
>This project is created for the data analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data. The project uses Python for anything related to data and Flask for writing a webapp. This is a ongoing project intended for improving the working knowledge of python and leanring new tools and techniqiues as we make progress.

## General info
The project started from the idea of doing something interesting during Coivid19 lockdown. We wanted to spend our time honing our python skills. The initial project was just creating a simple visulization from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) data using pandas and matplotlib in Python. As we started working on the project and researching on the subject we had a lot of ideas. The project evolved beyond just a single python file.

We wanted to explore the full spectrum of Python data analysis and then wanted to showcase what we did to the world. To achieve this, we looked for various frameworks and finialized on Flask to develop a webapp. We are data professionals but we didnt mind exploring this part of the world as we had little experince in this area.

## Technologies

We are using the following tools for development:
 - VS Code 
 - Anaconda 
 - MySQL Workbench 8.0.21
 - MySQL Community Server 8.0.21  

* Python  -- version 3.7.2
    * DataProcessing
      * Pandas 
      * numpy
      * requests
      * bs4 
      * io
      * sqlalchemy 
      * pymysql
    * Visualization  
      * matplotlib
      * seaborn
      * bokeh
      
* Web Framework 
   * Flask 

## Setup
If you want to setup and run the project locally you need to condsider the tools and frameworks. 

There are 3 parts to this. 

1 Python Setup 
2 Database server/Manager setup 
3 Flask setup 


  * Python setup: 
    - There are two options to setup your python envoirnment.Depending upon the envoirnment , you will have to install the dependencies on your machine

  1. Python from offial [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website:
      + `$ pip install Pandas`
      + `$ pip install numpy`
      + `$ pip install requests`
      + `$ pip install bs4`
      + `$ pip install io`
      + `$ pip install sqlalchemy`
      + `$ pip install pymysql`
      + `$ pip install matplotlib`
      + `$ pip install seaborn`
      + `$ pip install bokeh`  
      + `$ pip install Flask`
    
   2. Anaconda envoirnment for Python:
      + `$ pip install bs4`
      + `$ pip install io`
      + `$ pip install pymysql`
      + `$ pip install Flask`
   
 * Database Server setup:
